This repository demonstrates a common issue in MATLAB:  handling NaN (Not a Number) values as function inputs. The original `bug.m` script shows a function that doesn't explicitly handle NaN inputs. This leads to NaN being propagated through the calculation without any error message or indication of a problem. The solution, in `bugSolution.m`, provides improved error handling, either by using `isnan()` to detect NaN and handling them explicitly or by adding input validation.  This highlights the importance of robust input validation and error handling to enhance the reliability and predictability of MATLAB code.
